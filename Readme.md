**Important** : this is alpha version non-officially released software... barely (but still) running.

## Requirements ##

To try Fishbowl you need :

 - a Common lisp implementation (Fishbowl is developed using SBCL, and portability is not at this stage a major requirement)

 - Quicklisp (cf. http://www.quicklisp.org/)

 - IPython (only tested with IPython3 v.2.x.0)

## Quick launch ##

try to run :

    sh run-fishbowl.sh
