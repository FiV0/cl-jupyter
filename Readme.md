## Requirements ##

To try Fishbowl you need :

 - a Common lisp implementation, for now

   - either SBCL 1.2.x or above (with native threads enabled)

   - or Clozure CL 1.10 or aboce (with native threads enabled) ...

   - ECL is planned, for other implementations please fill an issue.

 - Quicklisp (cf. http://www.quicklisp.org/)

 - Python 3.2 or above

 - IPython 2.1 or above

## Quick launch ##

For simple interactions on the console, just type:

    python3 ./run-fishbowl.py     (or directly ./run-fishbowl.py if python3 is in PATH)

```
In [1]: (* 2 21)
Out[1]: 42

In [2]: 
```

By default, Fishbowl assumes SBCL as the default lisp implementation. Using CCL instead requires
the following command line:

    python3 ./run-fishbowl.py  --lisp=ccl


**Note**: Fishbowl seems to work better with CCL on MacOS  (but on Linux everything's fine with SBCL).

## Notebooks ##

The real interest of Fishbowl is its use conjointly
 with the IPython notebook frontend. For a try, type:

    python3 ./run-fishbowl.py notebook

(for SBCL)

or

    python3 ./run-fishbowl.py notebook  --lisp=ccl

(for CCL)

The file `AboutFishbowl.ipynb` is an example of a Lisp-based notebook.

The file `AboutFishbowl.pdf` is a printable PDF version of this notebook that can be
generated by the IPython `nbconvert` tool.
